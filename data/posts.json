    "title": "The CN Tower Explained",
    "content": "The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower.[9][10][11][12] It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.[5][13][14]\n\nIt is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline[15][16] and attracts more than two million international visitors annually.[5][17] It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 350 metres (1,150 ft), and an entertainment complex.[18]\n\nHistory\nThe original concept of the CN Tower was first conceived in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large television and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, and to demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant after the opening of the MacMillan Yard north of the city in 1965 (then known as Toronto Yard). Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).[3][4][8]\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably First Canadian Place, which houses Bank of Montreal's head offices. The reflective nature of the new buildings reduced the quality of broadcast signals, requiring new, higher antennas that were at least 300 m (980 ft) tall. The radio wire is estimated to be 102 metres (335 ft) long in 44 pieces, the heaviest of which weighs around 8 tonnes (8.8 short tons; 7.9 long tons).[19]\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over point-to-point microwave links, whose dish antennas covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and The Top lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to The Top, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.[8][20]\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (currently named The Top, and originally dubbed 'Bud's Bubble' named after Bud Andrews) was not part of the plans until later. Bud Andrews (president of the Metro Centre Developments Group) felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. Also around this time, it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest free-standing structure to improve signal quality and attract tourists, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.[8][20]\n\nConstruction\n\nMap of the area immediately surrounding CN Tower shortly before the opening of Ripley's Aquarium of Canada in 2013\nThe CN Tower was built by Foundation Company of Canada with Canron of Etobicoke handling the steel and antenna fabrication work.\n\nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, 56,000 t (62,000 short tons; 55,000 long tons) of earth and shale were removed to a depth of 15 m (49.2 ft) in the centre, and a base incorporating 7,000 m3 (9,200 cu yd) of concrete with 450 t (496 short tons; 443 long tons) of rebar and 36 t (40 short tons; 35 long tons) of steel cable had been built to a thickness of 6.7 m (22 ft). This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.[20]\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised slipform at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about 6 m (20 ft) per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built 381-metre (1,250 ft) tall Inco Superstack in Sudbury, built using similar methods.\n\nThe tower contains 40,500 m3 (53,000 cu yd) of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive plumb bobs hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only 29 mm (1.1 in).[8][20]\n\n\nSkycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Top was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.[20]\n\nWhile still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.[6]\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but, during construction, the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter became available when the United States Army sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow's Ostankino Tower, and bringing the total mass to 118,000 t (130,000 short tons; 116,000 long tons).\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"[21]",
    "excerpt": "The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[3][8] Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name \"CN\" refers to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.",

With a population of 2,794,356 in 2021,[13] it is the fourth-most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario,[14] while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population of 6,712,341.[13] As of 2024, the Golden Horseshoe had an estimated population of 11,139,265 people[15] while the census metropolitan area had an estimated population of 7,106,379.[16] Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.[17][18][19]\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years.[20] After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown,[21] the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada.[22] During the War of 1812, the town was captured by the United States after they won the Battle of York in 1813, after which it was largely burned down and plundered by the American troops.[23] York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the City of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation.[24] The city proper has since expanded past its original limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi).\n\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada.[25][26] About half of its residents were born outside of Canada and over 200 ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.[27] While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.[28] The city is governed by Toronto City Council, a unicameral body whose members are elected every four years. City council is composed of 25 councillors, who each represent a geographical ward, and the mayor of Toronto who serves as head of council and the chief executive officer of the municipal government.[29][30]\n\nToronto is Canada's largest financial centre, and is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks,[31] and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations.[32] Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.[33][34][35] In 2022, a New York Times columnist listed Toronto as the third largest tech hub in North America, after the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City.[36] Toronto is also a prominent centre for music,[37] theatre,[38] motion picture production,[39] and television production,[40] and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets.[41] Its varied cultural institutions,[42] which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities,[43] attract over 26 million visitors each year.[44][45]",
