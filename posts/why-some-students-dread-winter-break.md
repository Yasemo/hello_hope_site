I was talking to a Grade 10 student after an assembly last December. The one kid stayed back while everyone else rushed out. He looked nervous.

"Mr. Noronha, do you do any workshops during the holidays?"

I told him "No sorry dude, schools are closed for the break"

"Yeah, I figured. Makes sense."

That's when I realized what he was really asking. He wasn't looking for a workshop. He was looking for an *escape route* from two weeks at home.

## The Holiday Myth We All Believe

We send students off in December with "Have a great break!" like we're doing them a favor. For a lot of kids, we're not. We're sending them to chaos, dysfunction, or complete isolation.

Some students are counting down to winter break. Others are counting down the days they have to survive it.

I've worked in schools for over 20 years, I was a corrections officer for young people *at the same time* for over 15 years. I know what isolation looks like. And I'm seeing it in December assembly audiences across Ontario.

The kid who won't make eye contact. The one who begs you to come back in January. The student who lingers in the hallway like they're trying to delay going home.

These students aren't excited about the holidays. They're bracing for them.

## What Makes December Different

During the school year, your building is a lifeline. Structure. Safety. Adults who notice them. Friends who actually text back. A place where someone knows their name.

Then December hits and that lifeline gets cut for two weeks.

And the weather makes everything worse.

Canadian winter isn't just cold. It's dark. Students leave for school in the dark. They come home in the dark. By 4:30pm, the sun is gone and so is any figurative light on the inside of the students themselves. For those already dealing with isolation, that darkness compounds everything.

The science on this is clear: lack of sunlight affects mood, energy, and motivation. Seasonal Affective Disorder hits students (and staff) hard in December and January. Add that to two weeks of isolation at home and you have a perfect storm for depression. And we all know that you don't have to be diagnosed with depression to experience the severe symptoms.

Students who were managing during the fall start struggling in December. The ones who were already struggling get worse. And winter break removes the one stable structure helping them cope.

For students in dysfunctional homes, winter break means:

Two weeks with absent parents or parents who shouldn't be present; no escape from family conflict. Watching everyone else's Instagram stories about perfect holiday moments while sitting alone. Days with no one to talk to and nowhere to go.

And nowhere to go is literal in Canadian winter. It's not like summer where you can leave the house and walk around. December in Ontario means staying inside. Trapped. For students whose home is the problem, winter break means being stuck in that environment with no escape route.

Can't go outside for relief because it's freezing. Can't go anywhere else because everything's closed for the holidays. Just two weeks trapped in whatever dysfunction exists at home, in the dark, with no structure and potentially no adults who even notice.

The holidays aren't depressing because of some chemical imbalance that magically appears in December. They're depressing because some students lose their only stable environment for two weeks straight.

And we never talk about it because we're all supposed to love the holidays.

## What Schools Miss

Most schools plan December around celebration: holiday concerts, classroom parties, gift exchanges. All of it *assumes* every student has something to celebrate and somewhere stable to celebrate it.

We don't plan for the students who have nothing to go home to.

I'm not saying cancel the celebrations. I'm saying we need to acknowledge that December isn't magical for everyone. Some of your students are sitting through holiday assemblies feeling completely alone.

After connecting with over 1000 audiences in schools all over Canada, here's what I've learned: the students who need support most in December are the ones we miss because we're not looking for them.

They don't raise their hands and say "My home life is hell and I'm dreading the next two weeks." They smile, say "Have a great break," and disappear.

## What You Can Do Before They Leave

You have students right now who are dreading winter break. You might not know which ones but you can give all of them tools for dealing with isolation before they leave your building.

This isn't about counseling every kid individually. It's about normalizing the conversation about loneliness and giving practical strategies they can actually use.

**Name the reality.** Tell your students not everyone loves the holidays. Say it out loud. Give permission for students to acknowledge their own reality instead of performing holiday cheer. Just naming it helps.

**Teach them to recognize isolation in themselves.** Most students don't know they're lonely. They think they're fine because they have followers and notifications. Teach them what loneliness actually looks like: the heaviness that doesn't go away, the sense of disconnection even in crowds, the feeling that no one really knows them.

**Give them language for reaching out.** Students don't know how to ask for help. They think "I'm lonely" sounds weak or pathetic. Give them better language such as *"I'm feeling disconnected.", "I need to talk to someone." or "Things are heavy right now."* Language matters.

**Provide actual resources.** Not just "talk to someone if you're struggling." Give them specific numbers, apps, people they can reach during the break. Kids Help Phone. Crisis text lines. Specifics, not generalities.

**Create connection opportunities before the break.** Let students exchange contact info with classmates they actually want to stay connected with during December. Not forced buddy systems. Real friendships. Give them time to make plans to connect during the break if they want to.

The goal isn't to fix every student's home situation. You can't do that. The goal is to equip them with tools for dealing with isolation so they don't spend two weeks drowning in it.

## What Hello Hope Does Differently

My Hello Hope program focuses specifically on battling loneliness and disconnection. Not inspiring kids to "stay positive." Giving them actual strategies for surviving isolation and building authentic connection.

We talk about the difference between contact and connection, why having 500 friends online doesn't prevent loneliness, the science behind why face-to-face interaction matters. how to recognize when they're isolated and how to reach out when reaching out feels impossible.

Students leave with practical tools they can use during winter break. Not motivational speeches about the holidays being magical. Real strategies for dealing with the reality that for some students, the holidays *are* hell.

I've had students come back in January and tell me they used the connection strategies over the break. They reached out to someone. They recognized their own loneliness and did something about it. That's what we're aiming for.

## December Matters More Than You Think

What happens in December sets the tone for January. Students who spend two weeks isolated come back in worse shape than they left. The ones who felt disconnected in December feel even more disconnected by February.

You can change that trajectory. Use December assemblies to equip students before they leave. Don't waste the last two weeks of the semester on fluff. Give them tools they can actually use.

Not all your students are excited for winter break. Some are dreading it. The question is what are you going to do about it before they walk out your doors.

You have time. Use it.
