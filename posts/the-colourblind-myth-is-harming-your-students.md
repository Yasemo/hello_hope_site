A teacher told me she doesn't see colour. She said it like it was a compliment.

It's not. It's erasure.

## What "I Don't See Color" Really Means

When you say you don't see colour, you think you're saying "I treat everyone equally." What students of colour hear is "I don't see you."

Their race isn't something they can turn off. It's part of their identity, their experience and part of how the world treats them every single day.

When you refuse to see it, you're refusing to see their reality.

I've spoken over 1000 times to students in assemblies, parents in workshops and educators in PD sessions across Canada. Every time I deliver my "Colour Blind?" program, educators tell me they appreciate the frank conversation. Then some of them say "But I really don't see colour."

That's the problem. You should see it. You should acknowledge it. You should understand how it shapes every student's experience in your building.

Colourblindness isn't equality. It's avoidance.

## Where This Started

The colourblind approach came from good intentions. In the 1960s and 70s, it was progress to say "I don't care what colour you are, I'll treat you the same."

That made sense in that context. People were fighting against explicit racial discrimination. Saying "I don't see colour" was a way of rejecting racism.

But we're not in the 1960s anymore. The conversation evolved. Racism got more sophisticated. And colourblindness became a shield against uncomfortable conversations instead of a stand against discrimination.

Now when educators say "I don't see colour," what they're really saying is "I don't want to talk about race." And that silence is harming students of colour more than they realize.

## Why Colourblindness Fails

Here's what happens when schools adopt a colourblind approach:

Teachers don't address racial incidents because they "don't see colour." Students of colour face microaggressions daily and nobody names it. A mother shared a heartbreaking story of racial violence happening at her son's school. Some curriculum stays centered on white experiences because acknowledging other perspectives means acknowledging race. Discipline disparities persist because administrators won't examine how race affects their decisions.

Colourblindness doesn't prevent racism, it prevents us from seeing racism that's already happening.

I worked as a corrections officer for over 15 years before I got into public speaking. In that system, I saw how refusing to acknowledge race allowed systemic problems to continue unchecked. The same thing happens in schools.

When you refuse to see colour, you refuse to see how colour shapes student experiences. You miss the racism happening in your building because you're not looking for it.

Students of colour know this. They see us looking away. They hear our silence when racist comments get made. They notice which history gets taught and which gets skipped. They're not fooled by our colorblind approach.

## What Students of Colour Need Instead

Students of colour don't need you to pretend you don't see their race. They need you to see it and value it; going from colour blind to colour kind.

They need us to acknowledge that their experience is different because of their race. They need us to notice when racism happens in our building and address it directly. They need us to center their stories in our curriculum, not just in February.

They need us to stop performing equality and start practicing it.

Here's what that looks like in practical terms:

**See race and talk about it openly.** When a racial incident happens, name it. Don't dance around it with vague language about "respecting differences." Call it what it is. Students need adults who aren't afraid to say the word racism out loud.

**Understand systemic racism, not just individual prejudice.** Most educators think racism means personal hatred. That's not the problem anymore. The problem is systems and policies that disadvantage students of colour even when nobody has hateful intent. Learn the difference between individual bias and systemic racism. Then address both.

**Examine your own unconscious bias.** Every educator has it. We have students we connect with more easily, students we discipline more quickly, students we call on more often. If students of colour are consistently getting different treatment, that's not a coincidence. That's bias we need to address.

**Center diverse voices in your curriculum.** Don't just add a unit on Black history in February or Indigenous culture in November. Make sure your entire curriculum reflects diverse perspectives year-round. Students of colour need to see themselves in what you teach, not just in special "diversity" lessons.

**Create space for difficult conversations about race.** Students need to talk about racism. Not just in your equity club or diversity committee but in regular classrooms. Give them language for discussing race without shutting down. Model how to have these conversations without defensiveness or guilt.

This isn't about making white students feel bad, it's about creating a school culture where racism gets named and addressed instead of ignored.

## From 'Not Racist' to Anti-Racist

Here's the shift educators need to make: being "not racist" isn't enough anymore.

Not racist is passive. It means you personally don't hold racist beliefs. That's good. It's not sufficient.

Anti-racist is active. It means you actively work to dismantle racist systems. You notice racism happening and you interrupt it. You examine your own bias and change your behavior. You center the experiences of students of colour in your decision-making.

Not racist maintains the status quo. Anti-racist changes it.

Most educators think being "not racist" makes them good people. It does. But good people can still participate in racist systems without realizing it. That's what I help schools understand in my "Colour Blind?" program.

I'm not here to call teachers racist. I'm here to help people who are in-charge within a system see how racism operates in that system even when nobody has hateful intent. And I'm here to give them tools for moving from "not racist" to actively anti-racist.

## What This Looks Like in Real Schools

I was at a high school in Ontario where students who were not racialized who were making a bit of noise in the hallway were gently told by the staff to "head back to class and quiet down". Those same students told me that they observed students of colour on the other side of the hallway (who were making the same amount of noise) being snapped at by the staff like "they were dogs". The non-racialized students identified that the way the racialized students were being addressed by the staff was dehumanizing.

That's exactly the problem. They didn't see how race shaped their perception of the behaviour. They didn't notice they held the Black student to a different standard. Colourblindness allowed that disparity to continue unchallenged.

In another school, a teacher told me she doesn't discuss race in her classroom because she treats all students the same. Meanwhile, students of colour in that school told me they face racial comments daily and no teacher ever addresses it.

That teacher thought her colourblind approach was creating equality. Actually, it was creating silence that allowed racism to flourish.

This happens in schools across Ontario. Well-meaning educators adopt colourblind approaches thinking they're preventing racism. Instead, they're preventing conversations about racism that students desperately need.

## The Discomfort Is the Point

Talking about race makes people uncomfortable. Especially white educators who grew up being taught that discussing race is rude.

That discomfort is necessary; you can't address racism without acknowledging it exists. You can't create change without examining your own role in maintaining harmful systems.

Students of colour live with discomfort about race every single day, they navigate microaggressions, stereotypes, and discrimination constantly, and our discomfort during a conversation about race is not comparable.

If we are more worried about our own discomfort than the daily harm students of colour experience, that's a problem we need to address.

## What "Colour Blind?" Program Does

My "Colour Blind?" program gives students and educators a framework for understanding conscious and unconscious bias. We talk about how systemic racism operates, what it means to be anti-racist instead of just "not racist," and we give practical steps for transforming yourself and your school culture.

This isn't a guilt session. I'm not here to make white students feel bad about being white. I have literally heard hundreds of testimonies from students who are white telling me they want to help make things better after listening to my talk. They want to make things better for everyone and specifically their racialized neighbours. I'm here to help all students understand how racism operates and what they can do about it.

Students of colour need validation that what they experience is real. White students need education about how racism affects their peers. And educators need tools for creating truly equitable schools instead of just performing equality.

We use real examples from Ontario schools. We talk about actual incidents students face. We discuss what meaningful action looks like versus performative allyship. And students leave equipped to be actively anti-racist in their schools and communities.

## The Stakes Are Higher Than You Think

Your colourblind approach might feel safe. It might feel like the neutral position but it's not.

Every day we avoid discussing race, students of colour in our buildings face racism without adult support. Every time we say "I don't see colour," we signal that their experiences don't matter. Every incident we don't address teaches students that racism is acceptable in our school.

Silence isn't neutral, it maintains the status quo. And the status quo is harming students of colour right now.

We have a choice: keep performing colourblindness and watch racism continue unchallenged. Or start the difficult work of becoming actively anti-racist and actually create the equality we claim to believe in.

Students of colour (and those who are not) are watching to see which one you choose.
