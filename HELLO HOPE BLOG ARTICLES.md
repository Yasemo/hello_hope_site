## **ARTICLE 1: Why Some Students Dread Winter Break (And What You Can Do About It)**

I was talking to a Grade 10 student after an assembly last December. The one kid stayed back while everyone else rushed out. He looked nervous.

"Mr. Noronha, do you do any workshops during the holidays?"

I told him “No sorry dude, schools are closed for the break”

"Yeah, I figured. Makes sense."

That's when I realized what he was really asking. He wasn't looking for a workshop. He was looking for an *escape route* from two weeks at home.

### **The Holiday Myth We All Believe**

We send students off in December with "Have a great break\!" like we're doing them a favor. For a lot of kids, we're not. We're sending them to chaos, dysfunction, or complete isolation.

Some students are counting down to winter break. Others are counting down the days they have to survive it.

I've worked in schools for over 20 years, I was a corrections officer for young people *at the same time* for over 15 years. I know what isolation looks like. And I'm seeing it in December assembly audiences across Ontario.

The kid who won't make eye contact. The one who begs you to come back in January. The student who lingers in the hallway like they're trying to delay going home.

These students aren't excited about the holidays. They're bracing for them.

### **What Makes December Different**

During the school year, your building is a lifeline. Structure. Safety. Adults who notice them. Friends who actually text back. A place where someone knows their name.

Then December hits and that lifeline gets cut for two weeks.

And the weather makes everything worse.

Canadian winter isn't just cold. It's dark. Students leave for school in the dark. They come home in the dark. By 4:30pm, the sun is gone and so is any figurative light on the inside of the students themselves. For those already dealing with isolation, that darkness compounds everything.

The science on this is clear: lack of sunlight affects mood, energy, and motivation. Seasonal Affective Disorder hits students (and staff) hard in December and January. Add that to two weeks of isolation at home and you have a perfect storm for depression. And we all know that you don’t have to be diagnosed with depression to experience the severe symptoms.

Students who were managing during the fall start struggling in December. The ones who were already struggling get worse. And winter break removes the one stable structure helping them cope.

For students in dysfunctional homes, winter break means:

Two weeks with absent parents or parents who shouldn't be present; no escape from family conflict. Watching everyone else's Instagram stories about perfect holiday moments while sitting alone. Days with no one to talk to and nowhere to go.

And nowhere to go is literal in Canadian winter. It's not like summer where you can leave the house and walk around. December in Ontario means staying inside. Trapped. For students whose home is the problem, winter break means being stuck in that environment with no escape route.

Can't go outside for relief because it's freezing. Can't go anywhere else because everything's closed for the holidays. Just two weeks trapped in whatever dysfunction exists at home, in the dark, with no structure and potentially no adults who even notice.

The holidays aren't depressing because of some chemical imbalance that magically appears in December. They're depressing because some students lose their only stable environment for two weeks straight.

And we never talk about it because we're all supposed to love the holidays.

### **What Schools Miss**

Most schools plan December around celebration: holiday concerts, classroom parties, gift exchanges. All of it *assumes* every student has something to celebrate and somewhere stable to celebrate it.

We don't plan for the students who have nothing to go home to.

I'm not saying cancel the celebrations. I'm saying we need to acknowledge that December isn't magical for everyone. Some of your students are sitting through holiday assemblies feeling completely alone.

After connecting with over 1000 audiences in schools all over Canada, here's what I've learned: the students who need support most in December are the ones we miss because we're not looking for them.

They don't raise their hands and say "My home life is hell and I'm dreading the next two weeks." They smile, say "Have a great break," and disappear.

### **What You Can Do Before They Leave**

You have students right now who are dreading winter break. You might not know which ones but you can give all of them tools for dealing with isolation before they leave your building.

This isn't about counseling every kid individually. It's about normalizing the conversation about loneliness and giving practical strategies they can actually use.

**Name the reality.** Tell your students not everyone loves the holidays. Say it out loud. Give permission for students to acknowledge their own reality instead of performing holiday cheer. Just naming it helps.

**Teach them to recognize isolation in themselves.** Most students don't know they're lonely. They think they're fine because they have followers and notifications. Teach them what loneliness actually looks like: the heaviness that doesn't go away, the sense of disconnection even in crowds, the feeling that no one really knows them.

**Give them language for reaching out.** Students don't know how to ask for help. They think "I'm lonely" sounds weak or pathetic. Give them better language such as *"I'm feeling disconnected.", "I need to talk to someone." or "Things are heavy right now."* Language matters.

**Provide actual resources.** Not just "talk to someone if you're struggling." Give them specific numbers, apps, people they can reach during the break. Kids Help Phone. Crisis text lines. Specifics, not generalities.

**Create connection opportunities before the break.** Let students exchange contact info with classmates they actually want to stay connected with during December. Not forced buddy systems. Real friendships. Give them time to make plans to connect during the break if they want to.

The goal isn't to fix every student's home situation. You can't do that. The goal is to equip them with tools for dealing with isolation so they don't spend two weeks drowning in it.

### **What Hello Hope Does Differently**

My Hello Hope program focuses specifically on battling loneliness and disconnection. Not inspiring kids to "stay positive." Giving them actual strategies for surviving isolation and building authentic connection.

We talk about the difference between contact and connection, why having 500 friends online doesn't prevent loneliness, the science behind why face-to-face interaction matters. how to recognize when they're isolated and how to reach out when reaching out feels impossible.

Students leave with practical tools they can use during winter break. Not motivational speeches about the holidays being magical. Real strategies for dealing with the reality that for some students, the holidays *are* hell.

I've had students come back in January and tell me they used the connection strategies over the break. They reached out to someone. They recognized their own loneliness and did something about it. That's what we're aiming for.

### **December Matters More Than You Think**

What happens in December sets the tone for January. Students who spend two weeks isolated come back in worse shape than they left. The ones who felt disconnected in December feel even more disconnected by February.

You can change that trajectory. Use December assemblies to equip students before they leave. Don't waste the last two weeks of the semester on fluff. Give them tools they can actually use.

Not all your students are excited for winter break. Some are dreading it. The question is what are you going to do about it before they walk out your doors.

You have time. Use it.

## **ARTICLE 2: Your Students Have 500 Friends Online and Feel Completely Alone**

A Grade 9 student told me she has 1,200 Instagram followers and can't name five real friends.

That's not a social media problem. That's a crisis.

### **The Numbers Don't Add Up**

Your students have more ways to stay in contract than any generation in history. They text, snap, DM, comment, like, share. **They're in constant contact but they don't have a connection. And they can't tell the difference.**

And they're lonelier than ever.

After speaking to over 200,000 students across Ontario, here's what I'm seeing: students with hundreds of online connections and zero authentic relationships. Kids who can't remember the last time they had a real conversation with someone who actually knows them.

### **What Contact Looks Like vs. What Connection Looks Like**

Contact is surface level. Likes. Comments. Streaks. Quick texts. Memes. Content consumption together. Performative interaction.

Connection is different. It's being seen, known, understood. It's conversations that go deeper than "what's up." It's relationships where you can be yourself without performing. It's people who notice when you're struggling without you having to announce it.

Most of your students have plenty of contact. Very few have real connection.

In my assemblies, I ask students to think about who actually knows them. Not who follows them. Who knows them. Who could tell when something's wrong. Who they could call at 2am if they needed help.

The silence in the room tells you everything.

### **Why This Happened**

Social media didn't create loneliness. But it gave us an illusion that we're more connected than we actually are.

Students think having followers means having friends. They think “likes” equal validation. They think keeping streaks alive means maintaining relationships. None of that is true.

The science is clear. Face-to-face interaction triggers empathy in ways screens don't. When you're talking to someone in person, you read facial expressions, body language, and tone. You connect on a different level and that's what builds real relationships.

When you're texting, you miss all of that. You get content without context, information without intimacy, and contact without connection.

Your brain knows the difference. That's why students can spend all day online and still feel empty.

### **The Downgrade of Friendship**

Here's what students tell me: the word "friend" doesn't mean what it used to mean.

In their parents' generation, friend meant someone you spent time with. Someone you knew in real life. Someone you had history with.

Now friend means someone who follows you. Someone you've never met. Someone who liked your post once or added to your “views”.

The definition got downgraded and students don't even realize what they've lost.

I've had students argue with me that their online friends are just as real as face-to-face friends. Then I ask them: "When's the last time you had a conversation longer than five messages?" They can't answer.

This isn't about demonizing technology. I use social media. I'm on Instagram. Technology isn't the enemy. The problem is when it replaces human connection instead of enhancing it.

### **Now Add AI to the Mix**

Just when we thought it couldn't get worse, AI companions entered the picture.

Students are now having "relationships" with chatbots. My 8-year old son said chat GPT is his friend (and we don’t even use chat GPT in our home)\!. AI friends who are always available, never judge, never disagree. They text with apps that simulate conversation. They confide in algorithms that don't actually care.

I've had students tell me their AI friend understands them better than real people do. That's not a compliment to the AI. That's an indictment of how disconnected they are from actual humans.

AI companions feel safe because they're not real. You can't be rejected by a chatbot. You can't be vulnerable and get hurt. You can't disappoint an algorithm. But you also can't be truly seen, known, or loved by software.

Students are trading the risk of real connection for the safety of simulated relationship. And they're calling it friendship.

The loneliness epidemic just got an AI amplifier; students already struggled to build authentic connections with real people but now they're practicing relationship skills with bots instead. That's not preparing them for human connection. It's training them to prefer artificial interaction.

Your brain knows the difference between human connection and AI conversation. That's why students can spend hours chatting with AI and still feel empty afterward. The simulation might look like relationship, but it doesn't satisfy the need for authentic human connection.

This is the next frontier of the loneliness crisis. And most schools don't even know it's happening.

### **What This Looks Like in Schools**

You see this every day. Students sitting together at lunch, all on their phones. Hallways full of kids walking past each other without making eye contact. Group projects where nobody talks, they just share Google Docs.

Students texting each other from across the room because actual conversation feels awkward. Kids who can perform for 1,000 followers but can't have a one-on-one conversation without their phone as a buffer.

This is the loneliness epidemic too many of our schools have refused to name.

My Administrator friends tell me about how they talk about mental health, run wellness campaigns, and bring in speakers (like me) to talk about anxiety and depression. All of that matters. But nobody's talking about the root issue: students are disconnected from each other.

You can't solve anxiety without solving isolation. You can't fix depression without rebuilding authentic connection.

### **What Students Need to Hear**

Students need permission to admit they're lonely. Right now, loneliness feels like failure. Like something's wrong with them if they have followers but still feel alone.

It's not failure. It's reality. And they're not the only ones experiencing it.

In my Hello Hope assemblies, I normalize the conversation about loneliness. I tell students the science behind why screens don't satisfy the need for human connection. I give them language for what they're experiencing.

And I give them practical strategies for moving from contact to real connection.

Here's what that looks like:

**Recognize the difference between contact and connection.** Students need to understand that texts and likes don't build relationships. Real connection happens face-to-face. If all your friendships exist through screens, you don't have friendships. And AI companions aren't friends at all, no matter how convincing the conversation feels.

**Start small with one person.** Don't try to rebuild your entire social circle overnight. Pick one real human you want to connect with more deeply. Have an actual conversation with them. Not through text. Not with an AI. Face-to-face with a real person. See what happens.

**Put the phone away during real interactions.** If you're with someone, be with them. Full attention. No checking notifications. No scrolling while they're talking. That's what connection requires.

**Ask better questions.** Stop asking "what's up" and expecting real answers. Ask questions that go deeper. "What's been heavy for you lately?" "What are you actually excited about right now?" Give people space to be real with you.

**Tell people what they mean to you.** Students don't do this anymore. They assume people know. They don't. Tell your friends you value them. Be specific about why. That's how you build real connection.

This isn't revolutionary. It's basic human interaction. But your students have forgotten how to do it.

### **WhatsApp Family**

One phrase keeps coming up after my assemblies. Students start using it in hallways. They quote it to each other. Teachers tell me they hear it weeks later.

"WhatsApp family."

It's my term for the people you stay in contact with but never actually connect with. The group chat you're in but don't really know anyone. The followers who would never show up if you actually needed help.

Students needed language for what they were experiencing. They needed a way to describe relationships that look real but feel empty. WhatsApp family gave them that.

When students start using that phrase, it means they're recognizing the difference between contact and connection. That's the first step toward building something real.

### **What Schools Can Do**

You can't ban phones. That's not the solution. And you can't force students to have deep conversations. That won't work either.

But you can create space for authentic connection. You can give students opportunities to interact without screens as buffers. You can teach them what real friendship actually looks like. And you can have honest conversations about why AI companions aren't substitutes for human relationships.

Stop treating loneliness like an individual problem that counseling can fix. It's a cultural problem. Your entire school culture needs to shift toward valuing real connection over performative interaction and simulated relationships.

That starts with naming the problem. Your students are lonely. They have hundreds of followers and zero real friends. Say it out loud. Make it okay to talk about.

Then give them tools for rebuilding authentic relationships. Not inspirational quotes about friendship. Actual strategies for connecting with people face-to-face.

That's what my Hello Hope program does. We don't inspire students to "be better friends." We equip them with practical tools for moving from contact to connection. We give them language for what they're experiencing and strategies for changing it.

### **This Generation Isn't Broken**

I hear a lot of people talk about Gen Z like they're a lost cause. Too addicted to screens, too anxious to function, too isolated to fix, and who prefer chatting with AI instead of real people because real humans feel too risky

That's wrong. This generation isn't broken. They're drowning in a system that replaced human connection with digital contact and simulated relationships, and nobody taught them the difference.

Your students want authentic connection. They're just not sure how to build it anymore. They need adults who will teach them what real friendship looks like and give them space to practice it, not just lecture them about phones or judge them for using AI. 

They're not too far gone. They're waiting for us to show them a better way.

## **ARTICLE 3: The Colourblind Myth Is Harming Your Students**

A teacher told me she doesn't see colour. She said it like it was a compliment.

It's not. It's erasure.

### **What "I Don't See Color" Really Means**

When you say you don't see colour, you think you're saying "I treat everyone equally." What students of colour hear is "I don't see you."

Their race isn't something they can turn off,iIt's part of their identity,  their experience and part of how the world treats them every single day.

When you refuse to see it, you're refusing to see their reality.

I’ve spoken over 1000 times to students in assemblies, parents in workshops and educators in PD sessions across Canad. Every time I deliver my “Colour Blind?” program, educators tell me they appreciate the frank conversation. Then some of them say "But I really don't see colour."

That's the problem. You should see it. You should acknowledge it. You should understand how it shapes every student's experience in your building.

Colourblindness isn't equality. It's avoidance.

### **Where This Started**

The colourblind approach came from good intentions. In the 1960s and 70s, it was progress to say "I don't care what colour you are, I'll treat you the same."

That made sense in that context. People were fighting against explicit racial discrimination. Saying "I don't see colour" was a way of rejecting racism.

But we're not in the 1960s anymore. The conversation evolved. Racism got more sophisticated. And colourblindness became a shield against uncomfortable conversations instead of a stand against discrimination.

Now when educators say "I don't see colour," what they're really saying is "I don't want to talk about race." And that silence is harming students of colour more than they realize.

### **Why Colourblindness Fails**

Here's what happens when schools adopt a colourblind approach:

Teachers don't address racial incidents because they "don't see colour." Students of colour face microaggressions daily and nobody names it. 2 hours before I wrote this article a mother who is on parent council at a high school shared a common heartbreaking story of racial violence happening at her son’s school. Some curriculum stays centered on white experiences because acknowledging other perspectives means acknowledging race. Discipline disparities persist because administrators won't examine how race affects their decisions.

Colourblindness doesn't prevent racism, it prevents us from seeing racism that's already happening.

I worked as a corrections officer for over 15 years before I got into public speaking. In that system, I saw how refusing to acknowledge race allowed systemic problems to continue unchecked. The same thing happens in schools.

When you refuse to see colour, you refuse to see how colour shapes student experiences. You miss the racism happening in your building because you're not looking for it.

Students of colour know this. They see us looking away. They hear our silence when racist comments get made. They notice which history gets taught and which gets skipped. They're not fooled by our colorblind approach.

### **What Students of Colour Need Instead**

Students of colour don't need you to pretend you don't see their race. They need you to see it and value it; going from colour blind to (dare I say) colour kind.

They need us to acknowledge that their experience is different because of their race. They need us to notice when racism happens in our building and address it directly. They need us to center their stories in our curriculum, not just in February.

They need us to stop performing equality and start practicing it.

Here's what that looks like in practical terms:

**See race and talk about it openly.** When a racial incident happens, name it. Don't dance around it with vague language about "respecting differences." Call it what it is. Students need adults who aren't afraid to say the word racism out loud.

**Understand systemic racism, not just individual prejudice.** Most educators think racism means personal hatred. That's not the problem anymore. The problem is systems and policies that disadvantage students of colour even when nobody has hateful intent. Learn the difference between individual bias and systemic racism. Then address both.

**Examine your own unconscious bias.** Every educator has it. We have students we connect with more easily, students we discipline more quickly, students we call on more often. If students of colour are consistently getting different treatment, that's not a coincidence. That's bias we need to address.

**Center diverse voices in your curriculum.** Don't just add a unit on Black history in February or Indigenous culture in November. Make sure your entire curriculum reflects diverse perspectives year-round. Students of colour need to see themselves in what you teach, not just in special "diversity" lessons.

**Create space for difficult conversations about race.** Students need to talk about racism. Not just in your equity club or diversity committee but in regular classrooms. Give them language for discussing race without shutting down. Model how to have these conversations without defensiveness or guilt.

This isn't about making white students feel bad, it's about creating a school culture where racism gets named and addressed instead of ignored.

### **From ‘Not Racist’ to Anti-Racist**

Here's the shift educators need to make: being "not racist" isn't enough anymore.

Not racist is passive. It means you personally don't hold racist beliefs. That's good. It's not sufficient.

Anti-racist is active. It means you actively work to dismantle racist systems. You notice racism happening and you interrupt it. You examine your own bias and change your behavior. You center the experiences of students of colour in your decision-making.

Not racist maintains the status quo. Anti-racist changes it.

Most educators think being "not racist" makes them good people. It does. But good people can still participate in racist systems without realizing it. That's what I help schools understand in my “Colour Blind?” program.

I'm not here to call teachers racist. I'm here to help people who in-charge within a system see how racism operates in that system even when nobody has hateful intent. And I'm here to give them tools for moving from "not racist" to actively anti-racist.

### **What This Looks Like in Real Schools**

I was at a high school in Ontario where students who were not racialized who were making a bit of noise in the hallway were gently told by the staff to “head back to class and quiet down”. Those same students told me that they observed students of colour on the other side of the hallway (who were making the same amount of noise) being snapped at(literally snapped at) by the staff supervising in the hallway like “they were dogs”. The non-racialized students identified that the way the racialized students were being addressed by the staff was dehumanizing\!

That's exactly the problem. They didn't see how race shaped their perception of the behaviour. They didn't notice they held the Black student to a different standard. Colourblindness allowed that disparity to continue unchallenged.

In another school, a teacher told me she doesn't discuss race in her classroom because she treats all students the same. Meanwhile, students of colour in that school told me they face racial comments daily and no teacher ever addresses it.

That teacher thought her colourblind approach was creating equality. Actually, it was creating silence that allowed racism to flourish.

This happens in schools across Ontario. Well-meaning educators adopt colourblind approaches thinking they're preventing racism. Instead, they're preventing conversations about racism that students desperately need.

### **The Discomfort Is the Point**

Talking about race makes people uncomfortable. Especially white educators who grew up being taught that discussing race is rude.

That discomfort is necessary; you can't address racism without acknowledging it exists. You can't create change without examining your own role in maintaining harmful systems.

Students of colour live with discomfort about race every single day, they navigate microaggressions, stereotypes, and discrimination constantly, and \=our discomfort during a conversation about race is not comparable.

If we are more worried about our own discomfort than the daily harm students of colour experience, that's a problem we need to address.

### **What “Colour Blind?” Program Does**

My “Colour Blind?” program gives students and educators a framework for understanding conscious and unconscious bias. We talk about how systemic racism operates, what it means to be anti-racist instead of just "not racist." and we give practical steps for transforming yourself and your school culture.

This isn't a guilt session. I'm not here to make white students feel bad about being white. I have literally heard hundreds of testimonies from students who are white telling me they want to help make things better after listening to my talk. They want to make things better for everyone and specifically their racialized neighbours. I'm here to help all students understand how racism operates and what they can do about it.

Students of colour need validation that what they experience is real. White students need education about how racism affects their peers. And educators need tools for creating truly equitable schools instead of just performing equality.

We use real examples from Ontario schools. We talk about actual incidents students face. We discuss what meaningful action looks like versus performative allyship. And students leave equipped to be actively anti-racist in their schools and communities.

### **The Stakes Are Higher Than You Think**

Your colourblind approach might feel safe. It might feel like the neutral position but it's not.

Every day we avoid discussing race, students of colour in our buildings face racism without adult support. Every time we say "I don't see colour," we signal that their experiences don't matter. Every incident we don't address teaches students that racism is acceptable in our school.

Silence isn't neutral, it maintains the status quo. And the status quo is harming students of colour right now.

We have a choice: keep performing colourblindness and watch racism continue unchallenged. Or start the difficult work of becoming actively anti-racist and actually create the equality we claim to believe in.

Students of colour (and those who are not) are watching to see which one you choose.
