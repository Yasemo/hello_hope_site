The reason is that he has hit on all our safe schools principles. He has addressed a lot of those topics that we often don't have the capacity to be able to address as school administrators or even as a school team. He broke it down in a way that the students understood, connected with them with 'real talk' and dropped wisdom. For me it was money very well spent!"</p>
