ABOUT HELLO HOPE CANADA
Aubrey Noronha founded Hello Hope Canada with one objective: to introduce as many people to the power of hope as possible. ​



We have hope that boys and men will increasingly partner alongside girls and women as peers and will be protectors of the vulnerable members of society.



We hope to increasingly foster gender equality and encourage girls and women in their identity as the leaders and heroes they are in the world.

​

We have hope that a society with racist and even "non-racist" ideas will eventually be outnumbered by courageous and caring anti-racist ideas and people.



We have hope that human connection will grow and thrive in our technological age and will replace despair and loneliness with increased empathy and care for our communities.

​

Through his passionate, energetic and strength-based programs, Aubrey hopes to bring this message to as many youth, families, educators and professionals as possible. Here's hoping.
